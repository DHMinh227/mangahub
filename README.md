this is how a project should never be built and run 
this is a reminder if you dont have clear plan and time
this is how you should start and try to copy
this is a reminder that a system is not a simple program 
this is reminder that all of these can run but never mean it good
this is reminder that pls just requirements is something need to be clear
this a reminder that if you work in a major you not interesting , you will never make it right ( not all IT and CS is the same , making hashing password and contract not the same with web building )
this is TRASH!!!
