    "description": "There are two sets of Novels in Trinity Blood, Reborn on the Mars (R.O.M.) and Rage Against The Moons (R.A.M.). The events in Rage Against the Moons take place before those in Reborn on The Mars. The books were written by Yoshida Sunao (and after his death, continued by Kentaro Yasui) with illustrations done by THORES Shibamoto. There are also 5 manga volumes currently available; the anime is produced by GONZO and there are 24 episodes in total. Similar in feel to a Hellsing or Trigun. The background is in the distant future, a post-apocalyptic world after the destruction brought about by Armageddon. The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire. Yet amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group \"AX\", led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have - even a Crusnik (a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires) to protect the peace effort. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Tokyopop)"

The book more-or-less follows the same plot as the game; however there are a few differences in plot from the game. There are ten chapters in the first book, and eight in the second. Some of the added information in the manga is added to explain certain points; for example, in the manga pierced ears is a traditional rite of Sheikah passage, although this is not included in the game."

As if that wasn't unusual enough, her scythe is a demon scythe called Soul Eater, which can change form from a scythe to a human-looking boy. In order to make Soul Eater powerful enough to be Death's Weapon, he must eat the souls of 99 humans and 1 witch. Along the way, the two of them face many different challenges, including a cat witch named Blair (who happens to have a thing for Soul) and a teacher who's been turned into a zombie (and wants him to join her!). Her fellow students, like the shadow ninja weapon meister named Black Star who always needs to be the center of attention, aren't much help, either. It'll be a miracle if Maka even survives, let alone manages to make Soul Eater into the Death Scythe.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ci\u003eNote: Includes four extra chapters.\u003c/i\u003e"

    "description": "The story involves human mutations called \"diclonii\", who are born with horns on their heads and possess telekinetic powers, in the form of invisible \"arms\" called vectors. The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfulness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSilpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or where they await execution for being too dangerous. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manages to do so, humanity will be nonexistent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nKouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ci\u003eNote: Chapter count includes 6 extras.\u003c/i\u003e"

Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha’s ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka’s Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one’s life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers’ attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Kodansha USA)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eNote:\u003c/b\u003e Won the Bungei Shunju Manga Award in 1975 and the Best U.S. Edition of International Material for the Eisner Award in 2004 and 2005."

He spots a young girl, Kilico Sakaki, at the scene of the crime and instinctively knows that she did it. After a bloody fight, Akira arrests her. Trained as a professional assassin by her stepfather, Toshio Sakaki, in everyday life, Kilico acts like an ordinary college student. Her arrest is treated as a mistake when she manages to hide all evidence of Shinichi's murder. Akira's subsequent investigation of Kilico runs into difficulty when he finds that it's too big for a police detective to handle. Her encounter with Akira makes Kilico remember her terrible past and have doubts about being an assassin. Kilico goes to Taiwan to train as a jewel connoisseur, the Sakaki family's legitimate business, behind which they hide all their illegitimate business. Fired for taking his investigation too far, Akira follows Kilico to Taiwan. The two meet again and become very close, as they get involved in the internal conflicts within the Tenrenban gang, Taiwan's biggest Mafia group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Kotonoha)"

However, sitting behind him is the beautiful, intelligent, and eccentric girl Haruhi Suzumiya, who in her class introduction blatantly states her singular desire in meeting aliens, time travelers, sliders, or espers. Interested, Kyon starts trying to make small talk with her before class, eventually leading to normal conversations with Haruhi. One day, after making a comment about Haruhi's displeasure with the available school clubs, he finds himself dragged into membership of the newly formed Spreading Excitement All Over the World with the Haruhi Suzumiya (or SOS) Brigade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the first of two manga adaptations of the light novel series. Both manga adaptations were published in Sh\u0026#333;nen Ace, but the earlier one (this one) was canceled after the first volume. The reasons for this stem from the fact that the manga was considerably different from the novel and had little input from the original author. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

Now he must see if she will accept him as a creature of the underworld…\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Source: CMX)"

She's kind-hearted, but her mouth spews the total opposite of what she means (which is probably due to the fact that she grew up with only male influence). And so she is seen as an arrogant, vulgar girl at her school, but all she wants is a girlfriend. Well, that is, until she gets accepted at the Maidens' Club, where she meets a guy named Kirie, with a somewhat unique habit that happens when a girl comes within a foot of him. And everyone says he's gay, even Hatsune. How will these two fare? Will Hatsune have a girlfriend at last? Will he be more than just a friend?\n"

Benio lost her mother when she was very young and has been raised by her father, a high-ranking official in the Japanese army. As a result, she has grown into a tomboy - contrary to traditional Japanese notions of femininity, she studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in often outlandish-looking Western fashions, and isn't as interested in housewife duties as she is in literature. She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman's right to a career and to marry for love. Benio's best friends are the beautiful Tamaki, who is much more feminine than Benio but equally interested in women's rights, and Ranmaru, a young man who was raised to play female roles in the kabuki theater and as a result has acquired very effeminate mannerisms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

    "description": "Ageha and her sister Hana are twins. At birth, their parents left Ageha in the care of their grandmother in the countryside. Hana was raised in the big city with her parents. However, when the girls were in first grade, their grandmother became ill and so, Ageha was sent to live with her parents and her twin sister in the city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe two girls are in high school now, and are complete opposites. Growing up in the countryside has made Ageha a bit of a tomboy; she's a quiet, reserved girl who doesn't look anything special. Hana, on the other hand, is outgoing, gorgeous and popular at school. Regardless, the two girls appear to have a stable, good relationship with one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne day when all of Ageha's classmates leave to attend a concert, Ageha finds herself alone to maintain the booth at school during the school fair. Ageha feels as if she's Cinderella who didn't get invited to go to the ball. Just when she was thinking those thoughts, a boy wearing a horse mask on his head runs into the classroom and hides underneath a table. His name is Kyuu. It turns out he's being chased by some girls. After the girls leave, Ageha is startled by Kyuu who demands that she serve him coffee. As she does so, Kyuu flips through her agenda booklet and discovers a photograph of Ageha and the boy she has a crush on, Ryuusei, who she has known from childhood but since they moved away, they have forgotten each other. Kyuu asks if she likes Ryuusei, and if she wants to be Ryuusei's girlfriend in a teasing sort of way, causing much embarrassment to the girl. Kyuu then tells her that if she believes in her heart that it is possible, it could come true. Kyuu tells her to shout out that she's Ryuusei's girlfriend and that they are going out and her life is very good, which Ageha does so. As soon as she speaks the words, Ryuusei appears at the classroom door, and recognizes Ageha as the girl from his childhood that he used to play with. Ageha secretly thinks of Kyuu as Cinderella's fairy godmother and cannot believe that it happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as Ageha and Ryuusei rekindle a friendship from long ago, Hana becomes suspicious or jealous of Ageha's relationship with Ryuusei. She becomes especially annoyed when she finds out that Ryuusei prefers Ageha to her. Hana then begins to formulate a plan to steal Ryuusei away from Ageha."
